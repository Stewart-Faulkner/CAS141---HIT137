HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female
with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2174**] with
a history of five myocardial infarctions, the last in [**2185-7-28**] as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 30%, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  On [**2185-11-11**],
she experienced transient episodes of left arm weakness
associated with slow speech.  Her husband called the
patient's doctor who recommended she present to the emergency
room.

On arrival her vital signs were stable.  Labs were
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were negative initially.  She
was admitted to the Neurology for work up of a question of
TIA or stroke.  She underwent MRI of the head upon admission
that was negative for an acute process.  While on the floor
on [**2185-11-11**], she was noted to become tachycardic in a sinus
rhythm to 150 and was noted to have rales on exam.  She was
given 40 mg of IV Lasix without significant response; she
received a second dose of 40 mg IV Lasix and then a code was
called when she subsequently was noted to drop her oxygen
saturation to the mid 80s on 100% nonrebreather.  She also
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.

She was intubated and briefly required Dopamine to maintain
her blood pressures.  She was then transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management of congestive heart
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2174**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 30%.
5.  Alzheimer's dementia.

Her primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1537**].  Her
neurologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

0.25 Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa.
2.  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care
Unit, she was intubated and sedated.  She had pink, frothy
sputum suctioned from her G tube.  Her lungs had audible
rales at the bases.  She had a regular rate and rhythm
audible upon precordial exam with no audible extra heart
sounds.  Her abdomen was benign with positive bowel sounds.
She had no edema with 1+ distal pulses.  She was responding
to stimuli, but was sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit had a
sodium 134, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN
20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 124, INR 1.1.  White count 7,
hematocrit 33, platelets 211.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a left
axis, left bundle branch block.  There was no comparison
available at the time.

Chest x-ray with patchy vascular markings consistent with
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission to the
Coronary Care Unit was that the patient was a 75 year-old
female with severe coronary artery disease who developed
symptoms of left arm discomfort on the day prior to
admission.  It may or may not have represented anginal type
symptoms.  She was now admitted directly from the floor in
apparently decompensated congestive heart failure in the
setting of elevated systolic blood pressure (as high as 200).

The patient was able to be weaned off of Dopamine
expeditiously upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit.  She
was diuresed aggressively and successfully with IV Lasix.
She had a PA catheter placed upon admission in order to guide
her management with initial pulmonary artery pressures of
35/10 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10.  Of note,
this was following aggressive diuresis.

The patient did well with subsequent titration up of after
load reduction with Captopril and initiation of Isordil.  She
was able to be extubated successfully on [**2185-11-14**].  She
underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a
severely depressed LV function with ejection fraction of 20
to 30% and akinesis of the inferior row posterior walls and
moderate hypokinesis at the LV as well as 1+ AR and MR.

The patient subsequently did well and at the time of this
dictation on [**2185-11-17**], she is awaiting transfer to the
General Medical Floor where she will await eventual
disposition most likely to short term rehab.

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a past medical
history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass grafting, multiple
myocardial infarctions, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 20-30% and hypertension.  The patient
was admitted for episodes of left arm weakness and developed
flash pulmonary edema and tachycardia in the hospital.  She
was transferred to the CCU for medical management and
diuresis.  The patient responded to treatment well and, on
[**2185-11-17**], she was transferred to the floor for further
medical care prior to discharge to rehabilitation.

The patient was stable throughout her course of
hospitalization on the medical floor.  She was restarted on
her preadmission medications.  Her congestive heart failure
was not an acute issue.  She was kept euvolemic throughout
the hospitalization and suffered no additional shortness of
breath, pulmonary edema or tachycardia.  Her blood pressure
did drop on occasion to 80-90/40.  The patient was
asymptomatic during these episodes and blood pressure
elevated spontaneously to greater than 100/50.

The patient had fevers in the CCU with negative blood
cultures.  She was started empirically on Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole.

On the hospital floor, she was noted to have one bloody
stool.  Hematocrit was stable.  The patient's family notes
that the patient has been having bloody stools on occasion
over the past few years.  They have related to her congestive
heart failure exacerbations.  The patient underwent an
abdominal CT which showed evidence of proctitis to a very
mild degree with some thickening of the bowel wall and
stranding.  The CT also noted an abnormally thickened and
calcified gallbladder wall with a question of worrisome
gallbladder.  The patient was referred go Gastroenterology.
She underwent a liver/gallbladder ultrasound which revealed
cholelithiasis and evidence of adenomyomatosis, a benign
non-premalignant condition for which no follow up is
necessary.  Due to the patient's age and presentation, late
onset of ulcerative colitis was suspected for the occasional
bloody stools.  On flexible sigmoidoscopy, the patient was
shown to have multiple non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  The
appearance was consistent with ulcerative colitis.  Biopsies
were taken and the results are pending.  Due to the patient's
very mild disease activity without pain and only occasional
bloody stools without a drop in hematocrit, it is not clear
at this time whether treatment with steroids or 5-ASA enemas
is indicated.  The patient will follow up with
Gastroenterology for these issues.  The patient's hematocrit
was stable throughout the admission.  The patient's diet was
advanced and she took p.o. well.

The patient is discharged in good condition to long term
rehabilitation.

IMAGING:
[**12-7**] CT C/A/P: TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from
the chest, abdomen and pelvis with the administration of IV
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
CT OF THE CHEST: Right pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. Left base opacification likely represents collapsed
left lower lobe which appears airless and filled with higher
density material, possibly blood. The patient has a nasogastric
tube which passes into the stomach. ETT tube appears
approximately 4.7cm above the carina.
The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature
and
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] solid organs are incompletely evaluated in the
absence of IV contrast. Within this limitation, the liver,
pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Note
is made of splenomegaly. Both kidneys show no evidence of large
masses. A non-obstructive 9-mm stone is noted within the lower
pole of the left kidney (601B, 32). Small stones are noted
within the right kidney. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.
Surgical sutures are noted in the RLQ, otherwise,
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] loops of
large and small bowel appear unremarkable. There is no free air
or free fluid within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
The structures within the pelvis are incompletely evaluated due
to the
presence of streak artifact due to bilateral total hip
replacements. Within this limitation, the patient is status post
a Foley catheter. A right femoral vein catheter is identified. A
possible rectal catheter is noted. Bilateral hip prosthesis are
noted; the right femoral component appears well seated within
the acetabular component; however, the left femoral component is
not well seated within the left acetabular component.
Decrease in vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body is noted
with possible retropulsion of fragment into the spinal canal and
indentation of the thecal sac. This is of indeterminate
chronicity, but likely represents more chronic process with the
presence of what looks like kyphoplasty material within L1
vertebral body. Intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature is not well
evaluated in the absence of contrast technique.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Left base
opacification likely represents collapsed left lower lobe which
appears
airless and filled with higher density material, possibly blood.

2. Left lower pole renal calculus.
3. Incomplete evaluation of the pelvis due to streak artifact.
4. Left total hip arthroplasty prosthesis shows femoral
component is not well seated within the acetabular component.
5. Loss of vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body with
possible
retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal; this is of
indeterminate
chronicity, however, appears to be chronic due to presence of
what appears to be kyphoplastic material.
.
[**12-7**] CT HEAD:TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained
through the head without the administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
There is no evidence of acute fracture or traumatic dislocation.
Bilateral
mastoid air cells are clear. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted
within
bilateral maxillary sinuses.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete
masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence
of large acute major vascular territory infarction.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is marked anterior rotation
of the
odontoid process relative to a thickened appearance of the body
of C2. The
finding likely represents a fracture/subluxation deformity.
There is resultant prominent central canal narrowing at this
level. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this
locale. It is possible that the finding represents a prior,
healed fracture, but clearly this question must be resolved,
through either obtaining prior records/imaging studies
immediately, and/or subsequent spinal CT imaging. In the
meantime, the patient's neck needs to be stabilized.
.
[**12-8**] CT CSPINE: COMPARISON: CT head from [**2160-12-7**] and
portable C-spine radiograph from [**2160-12-7**].

TECHNIQUE: Helical 2.5-mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from
the skull
base through the level of T2. Sagittal and coronal reformations
were obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is a large mass of new bone formation causing
fusion of the C1 and C2 vertebral bodies anteriorly, with
anterior subluxation of C1 with respect to C2(400b:27). This
results in severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the
posterior arch of C1. The degree of subluxation is unchanged
from the prior study. There is no fracture identified.
There is extensive fusion of every facet joint from C2 to T3,
comprising all the levels imaged. There is also interbody fusion
involving every cervical level. There has been surgical anterior
fusion at C6-7. There is extensive fusion of the lamina and
interlaminar ligaments throughout the visualized levels. In the
portion of thoracic spine included in the study, there is fusion
of costovertebral and costotransverse articulations. Comparison
with a torso CT of [**2160-12-8**] reveals similar ankylosis in the
lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. These findings indicate a
spondyloarthropathy with manifestations typical of ankylosing
spondylitis. Correlation with the remainder of her medical
history will be helpful.

IMPRESSION:
1. Anterior subluxation of C1 on C2 without evidence of
fracture. The
anterior arch of C1 is fused to the odontoid process via a thick
layer of bone that contributes to the subluxation. This produces
severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of
C1.
2. There are extensive fusions of multiple spinal joints most
suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.
3. No evidence of acute fracture.
.
[**12-7**] PELVIS PLAIN FILM: Comparison is made to selected images
from an [**Month/Day (4) 1676**] pelvic CT scan dated [**2160-12-7**].

SINGLE PORTABLE AP PELVIC FILM WAS OBTAINED [**2160-12-7**] AT 0452:
Bilateral total hip replacements are seen. The femoral and
acetabular
components appear to be well approximated on this single AP
view. The distal end of both femoral components is not included
on the image. There is no evidence of loosening of the femoral
components. Hypertrophic bone is seen lateral to the right
femoral component. A right femoral catheter is in place. No
displaced fracture of the pelvis is appreciated. Surgical chain
sutures are seen in the right lower quadrant, suggesting prior
colonic surgery. A Foley catheter is in place. Several
radiopaque densities are seen lateral to the left femoral
component within the soft tissues which may be sutural in
etiology. Clinical correlation is advised.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral total hip replacements with both appearing to be
normally positioned on this single portable view. No evidence of
displaced fracture of the pelvis.

Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within one of two paired
brachial veins, which extends to the axillary vein.

Portable chest x-ray [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent sizable parenchymal infiltrate in left
lower lobe
area. No new abnormalities in this portable chest examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 40984**] is a 46 year old female with a history of suicide
attempts and subsequent liver disease, multiple infections
including ESBL Klebsiella and osteomyelitis who takes chronic
steroids for ankylosis spondylitis presented from an outside
hospital intubated and requiring pressors.
.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE:
# Acute metabolic acidosis without respiratory compensation:
Her pH upon admission to ICU was 7.1 with a bicarb of 14, later
worsened to 7.09 with bicarb of 12.  The possible etiologies of
her primary metabolic acidosis include intoxication versus
sepsis.  The active [**Doctor Last Name 360**]/s seem to have suppressed her
respiratory drive (additional respiratory acidosis) as well as
causing a primary metabolic acidosis.  She was treated with IV
fluids with bicarbonate as well as hyperventilation on
mechanical ventilation in order to improve the acidosis and
elevated pCO2.  Also, the toxicology and psychiatry services
were consulted to assist with identifying the cause of her
ingestion.  Finally, she was started empirically on
piperacillin/tazobactam with vancomycin to cover for possible
aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: She was intubated upon arrival but able
to be ventilated well including a recruitment procedure to open
her atelectatic lung seen on CT.  She was extubated easily and
did well on room air afterwards.  As discussed above, it was
thought that she aspirated while she was impaired from an
unknown ingestion.  Her CT chest was consistent with some small
bilateral pneumonia.  Following stabilization and extubation,
induced sputum results returned positive for MRSA.  She
completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.  She remained afebrile
throughout remainder of course on the medical floor.  PICC was
discontinued prior to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
# Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive on admission to ICU.  Her
hypotension is of unclear etiology.  It seems possible that she
had sepsis--likely from pneumonia.  Also, she may have been down
long enough to miss her home florinef dose, resulting in
hypotension.  Lastly, the ingestion itself could have caused
hypotension.  She was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics as
above, and stress doses of steroids.  Blood pressures were
stable during floor course.  She was started on captopril when
she became hypertensive with subsequent good control.
.
# Psychologic issues:  We suspect that she had a purposeful
ingestion with suicidal attempt.  Blood tox was positive for
benzos and tricyclics.  Urine tox was positive for benzos,
cocaine, and opiates.  However, the patient did not admit
suicide ideation; she intermittently reported that she may have
accidentally ingested more medications than intended. Psychiatry
was consulted and they recommended a 1:1 sitter.  She was placed
on section 12.  She was followed by psychiatry and often refused
full interviewing.  She did not admit to suicide ideation but
given her prior suicide attempts and depression with inability
to care for herself, she was transferred to psych facility for
further care.  All of her psychiatric medications were held
during hospital stay.  She was started on low dose seroquel on
the floor prior to transfer to help with sleep.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis:  Her admission Creatinine was 2.2 (baseline is
< 1.0) with phosphate >7 and CK of [**Numeric Identifier 24587**].  She was treated with
IV fluids and alkalinization of the urine (with bicarb).  Her
creatinine improved to baseline and her CK trended down quickly.
.
# Transaminitis:  She has a history of liver disease secondary
to toxic ingestions.  Her AST/ALT ratio suggests EtOH damage.
APAP < 2 at OSH.  LFTs normalized by time of [**Numeric Identifier **].
.
# Odontoid fracture and Hip dislocation:  Patient originally
arrived in the ED with dislocated hip which was reduced.
However, while intubated she awoke and again dislocated her hip
while agitated.  It has been put in a brace after a second
reduction.  Her CT head showed an old odontoid fracture,
confirmed with CT neck.  She was kept immobilized until cleared
by ortho spine team.  For her hip, ortho recommended that she
continue with posterior hip precautions.  She is weight bearing
as tolerated.

History of Present Illness:
31F with h/o Crohn's disease refractory to medical mgmt
(remicade, etc) currently on slow steroid taper. Recently
admitted [**2-25**] with microperforation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] planned on
ileocecectomy on [**5-5**]. The pt now presents with epigastric pain
X 2 weeks in spite of being on cipro, flagyl, prednisone. Flagyl
d/c'd 2 weeks ago and put on prilosec by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**]. Over past
week, pain is worse and in past 24 hrs severe [**6-28**] pain in
epigastrum and RLQ. Pt reports sweating but denies fevers. This
AM, following taking her PO mediacation the pt reported emesis
10-15 times. She also noted [**8-28**] abdominal pain, mostly RLQ,
but also LUQ. Loose stools no melena or BRBPR. Pt reports dry
mouth but denies lighheadedness, dizziness, visual changes or
other presyncopal symptoms.

In ED, 99,4 115/69 120 17 100%RA. While in the ED, Tm 101.4 and
tachy to 130s, normotensive. WBC 5.1 with 15% bandemia, diffuse
peritonitis and rigid abdomen, diffusely tender. CT abd/pelvis
with likely early developing abscess with pockets of free air in
pelvis. The pt received 4L of NS, Dilaudid 1mg IV x7, Morphine
4mg IV, Zofran 4gm IX x1 for pain and tylenol 1gm PO. Abx were
initially continued with Cipro 400mg IV and Flagyl 500mg IV
which was later switched to Vanc 1g IV and Zosyn 4.5mg was
given. An NG tube was placed which the pt states relieved some
of her abdominal bloating.

Upon further review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Occasional chest pressure,
but denies tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,

Pertinent Results:
CT Abdomen (Wet-Read) [**2123-4-26**]
1. Increased size of pelvic collection, Image 2:61, with
multiple tiny pockets of extraluminal air. The collection shows
early signs of organizing to an abscess.
2. Worsening of bowel wall thickening, consistent with Crohn's
flare.
CT Abdomen [**2123-4-28**] (wet read)
Marked interval increase in intraperitoneal fluid tracking
through the
mesentery, around the liver, and collecting in the pelvis. Large
pre-sacral pelvic collection has increased in size and
demonstrates increased rim enhancement, concerning for
developing abscess. Hyperemic mesentery and omental inflammatory
changes, likely worsened since the prior study. Focal collection
previously identified in the mid-pelvis appears largely
unchanged. Redemonstration of bowel wall abnormalities c/w
Crohn's flare, largely stable.

severe flare and intravascular depletion.
.
# Abdominal Pain/Surgical Abdomen: Most likely [**12-21**] Crohn's Flare
given findings on CT (Multiple Tiny Pockets of Extraluminal Air,
Worsening bowel wall thickening consistent with Crohns flare).
Other less likely etiologies include perforated ulcer (given
chronic steroid use). Evaluated by surgery in ED and upon
admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Received IV vancomycin/zosyn. Per GI to
continue hydrcortisone 100 mg qdaily. NGT placed. Foley in
place. Strict NPO, serial abd exam.
- NPO
- Serial Abdominal Exam
-Antibiotics
-Hydrocortisone 100mg Daily
- Morphine 2-4mg IV PRN Abdominal Pain
.
# Sinus Tachycardia: In the setting of intravascular depletion,
crohns flare, abdominal pain.
- IVF resuscitation
- Pain Control with Morphine 2-4mg IV PRN
- Broad Spectrum ABx

.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 she was made NPO with
IVF/Foley/IVMeds/ABX. She was febrile to 102.9 with increased
pain. Her pain medication  was changed from morphine to dilaudid
with good effect. The patient also had a repeat CT scan showing
a fluid collection in her abdomen. She was taken to IR to have a
drain place. Scant thick pus aspirated and cultured.
.
A PICC line was placed and the patient was started on TPN with
bowel rest. She continued to spike temps to 103.0. Multiple
fever workups were done including BCX, UCX and CXR all negative
for infection. She had multiple CT scans done indicating
abcesses. She was taken to IR for Drain placement, 2 drains
placed for a total of 4 drains.
.
Despite the drain placements the patient continued to spike
temps to 104.6 on HD 19 requiring a cooling blanket. She was
than pre-op'd and taken to the OR for ex-lap, washout and drain
placement.
.
She returned to the floor. She was maintained as NPO, TPN was
continued along with a PCA, IVF, ABX. Infectious disease was
also consulted to recommend treatment. POD 1 the patient was
afebrile. However she continued to spike daily fevers there on
out. ID continued to follow the patient adjust antibiotics as
needed.
.
The patient c/o of severe pain and the pain service was
consulted. She was started on a fentynal patch and PO dilaudid
with good effect. At discharge the patient no longer needed the
fentynal patch, her pain was well controlled with dilaudid. Her
TPN was cycled and with the return of bowel function and flatus
her diet was advanced from sips to regular. Her TPN was d/c'd
once she tolerated regular diet.
All of her drains were d/c'd prior to d/c. The patient was
encouraged to have ensure with all meals. All D/C paperwork was
reviewed with the patient and all questions answered. She will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in [**11-20**] weeks.

Chief Complaint:
seizure and hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
47 L handed male with PMH sig for transverse myelitis dx [**12-8**]
undergoing tx with 6mo of steroids presents from OSH with
hematemesis, gastric ulcer with visible vessel s/p EGD and
cauterization here on [**2-14**].

In [**2123-11-3**], he started developing severe lower back pain
with weakness in his legs and numbness in his hands.  He had
been diagnosed by his PCP as having back arthritis.  He was
progressively getting worse and one day he fell and could not
stand up. His symptoms did not improve and he presented to [**Hospital1 2025**]
on [**2123-11-18**] with worsened hand/LE weakness 1/5 strength,
hyperreflexia. Full spine MRI at [**Hospital1 2025**] revealed questionable mass
and intramedullary T2 hyperintense from C2-L2 with cord
expansion and patchy enhancement. Further workup for
malignancies included negative abd/chest CT and brain MRI. CSF
analysis revealed WBC 8 [L 97% M 3%], glucose 85, protein 38.
[**Doctor First Name **], RF, HSV; mycoplasma PCR, VRDL pending; Gram stain, cx
showed NG. He was started on solu-medrol 1g IV daily x5d with
considerable improvement of LE strength. Repeat MRI showed
diminished T2 hyperintesities. He was discharged to home on
[**2123-11-27**] and arranged for solu-medrol taper. He was also started
on balcofen for spasticity, and told to f/u as outpatient in
[**Hospital 878**] clinic.

Shortly after d/c of steroids, symptoms relapsed. Presented here
[**12-6**] with bacteremia, septic right knee and weakness.  At that
time pt was found to have a septic joint and gout which was
treated appropriately with antibiotics and NSAIDs.

He was later transfered to the neurology service for w/u of his
weakness.  An MRI of the head was normal, but MRIs of the spine
revealed edema and enhancement C3-C6 suggestive for lymphoma vs
sarcoid vs myelitis. A chest CT revealed pulmonary nodules. A
biopsy of the nodules were performed, which showed only lung
parenchyma, however it is uncertain that the nodules were truly
biopsied. An LP revealed increased protein, though tap was
traumatic and many RBCs were present.  CSF viral studies-->+VZV,
-EBV, and -HSV PCR.  ACE normal.  He was started on a second
course of high dose steroids 1gm soulmedrol x5days to be
followed by a 6 month course of PO steroids. Pt was d/c'd home
on [**12-30**] with improving exam.

Pt had been doing well at home with PT/OT until [**2124-2-8**], when
pt's wife noticed pt undergo a possible seizure followed by
coffee ground emesis. The pt's body stiffened. He then began
having a rhythmic shaking of the LUE for about 30 seconds. Pt
was then unresponsive for 5-10 minutes, after which he had
coffee ground emesis. He was taken to OSH, where an EGD showed a
gastric ulcer with a visible vessel and a Hct was 26. Pt was
treated with H2 blocker and d/c'd home on [**2-13**]. The following
day, pt developed a second episode, which per the wife, was
exactly like the first, and was followed by a large amount of
hematemesis. Pt taken to OSH and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**],
where a HCT on admission was 24.3. He was admitted to the MICU
for UGIB.

MRI (brain)
No abnormalities noted

MRI (c-spine)
Compared to the previous examination, there is decreased
abnormal signal within the cervical cord, largely confined to
the region of C3 and C4. There does not appear to be abnormal
cord swelling at the present time. There is still some contrast
enhancement but this also appears to be reduced compared to the
previous examination. Degenerative disease is again seen
involving C3- C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and C6-C7 essentially
unchanged compared to the previous examination. For details, see
that report.

EEG

Brief Hospital Course:
1. NEURO- His last seizure was in [**2122-9-2**]. Based on his
history, probably had additional seizures before admission.
Here, he was started on Trileptal and has remained seizure free.
 MRI showed no evidence of intracranial pathology that may have
led to his recent seizures.  C-Spine MRI showed similar, though
decreased region of enhancement in the cervical cord at C3/4.
The etiology of his his cord pathology is not yet clear.  Was
thought to be neurosarcoid due to presence of pulmonary nodules,
but no clear evidence of granulomas or elevated ACE was seen.
Repeat CT of his chest here was normal, with no LAD and clear
lungs.  He has been on chronic steroids for several months
though, so his initial findings may have cleared in this
setting. In terms of malignancy, biopsy of the lung nodules was
non diagnostic in the past and the CSF cytology did not contain
adequate cells to rule this out as a possible cause.  Infectious
causes seem unlikley, but VZV was positive (pt never had clinic
varicella).  Had a repeat LP here with essentially normal cell
count, glucose, and very mildly elevated protein at 50.  This
was sent for TB-PCR and cytology.  Both pending at D/C.
  He has been on prednisone 60 mg for several months and
apparently worsened when they tried to taper him off this
medication.  We decreased him to 40 mg here and he will f/u with
neurology where they can continue to taper this as he tolerates.
  He had EEG here with no evidence of seizure activity, but his
episodes do sound suspicious for seizure.  Given this, will
continue his Trileptal as an outpt.
  Etiology of his neurological dysfunction still unclear, but
ddx includes TB, lymphoma, neurosarcoid(less likely), MS.
Apparently had diffuse enhancement of spinal cord on past MRI,
which is not classic for any of the above.  Repeat scan here is
much improved as above.  Will f/u on CSF studies.

2. GI - UGIB likely secondary to vessel in ulcer as seen on EGD.
 Received 2 units PRBCs.  This vessel was cauterized during this
admission and his Hct remained stable afterwards.  His diet was
slowly advanced and he was tolerating solids without issue by
discharge.  He did have 1 episode of heme positive stool while
here, but would expect this given his recent bleed and fact that
it was first BM since this.  No drop in his Hct with this.
Started on iron.  Also started on Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  WIll
continue this as outpt and f/u with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 10 days.

3. CV - He was ruled out for MI here.  He did have tachycardia
on telemetry with activity at times, but wasn't orthostatic.
Unclear etiology, but didn't suspect PE, dehydration,
arrhythmia.  Encouraged PO intake.  Held his ACE-I for the
majority of admission, but restarted when he was stable.  BP was
in 140s systolic without medication.

4.Gout:Continued his home allopurinol. No issues. Told pt to
avoid NSAIDS.
5.Pulm:Pt was continued on theophylline.  COuld have been
contributing to tachycardia, but has been on this for a long
time, so decided to continue it.
6.ID:Continued Bactrim for ppx as he is on high dose steroids.
